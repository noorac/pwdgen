This is a program I enjoy using, and as such I am attached to the way it is made. There are features planned in the future, and there are ideas. 

That doesn't mean it can't improve and be optimized. I welcome both critique and suggestions, as long as it is done respectfully. I particularily enjoy this project because I use it myself, and would love for it to become better.

Be nice to people, and let's have fun together, and learn from each other.
